Content:
- server.py
- client.py

System requirements:
- python3 (3.0 or above)

How to work:
1. client.py must be located and run on target machine
2. sever.py is located and run on the local machine or the server (real server is betteras the IP will not change - static)
3. if both are running on a normal computer, please update the host name on the client.py according to the IP address of the "server" as it changes once the computer is restarted. Otherwise, it stays constant.

Known limitation:
This method is originally designed for a not so complicated purpose.
